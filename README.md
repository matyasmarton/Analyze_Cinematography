# Analyze_Cinematography
This is a python script that uses Keras, OpenCV, DeepFace and FaceRecognition APIs alongisde two CNNs to analyze the photography in movies

Features of the script:
 - Predict the type and angle of a shot (70% accuracy) using Keras models built by me
 - Predict the gender and ethnicity of a person using DeepFace and FaceRecognition APIs
 
 Currently working on:
  - fixing the bug in the analyze function
  - deploying the project on Google Cloud
  - Adding a function that can direct where the light is coming from on a close-up of a face (calculation the coordinates of the brightest and darkest pixels, and drawing a vector between them)
